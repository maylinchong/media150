    <h2> Creative statement </h2>
         <p> Hi, I am Maylin. I am a freshman planning to major in graphic design, with a strong interest in visual marketing and how design influences the way people see and connect with brands. I am drawn to design because it combines creativity with communication. I enjoy working with visual elements like typography, color, layout, and imagery to create designs that are eye catching but also meaningful. The type of work I want to create includes branding, posters, advertising, and social media content, where visuals play a key role in shaping perception and delivering a message quickly and clearly. Visual marketing interests me because it requires thinking about both creativity and audience, not just making something look good.
             Outside of digital design, I enjoy creative activities such as scrapbooking, lettering, fashion, and photography. These interests influence my design process by encouraging experimentation with composition, texture, and style. I like taking photos with my digital camera and my phone, and I enjoy posting aesthetic images on Instagram as a way to practice visual storytelling and create cohesive visuals. I am inspired by fashion and beauty branding, magazine layouts, and everyday visuals found in digital media and advertising. Through my work, I want to explore themes of identity, aesthetics, and communication while continuing to develop my creative voice and technical skills as a designer.
