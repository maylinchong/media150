        <p> Photography is one of the main ways I express myself and understand the world around me. I usually take photos with my phone or digital camera, and I am drawn to everyday moments rather than big or dramatic scenes. I like photographing things like light through windows, streets, people from behind, or objects that feel personal or nostalgic. For me, photography is not just about capturing what something looks like, but about how it feels in that moment. It helps me slow down and notice things I might otherwise ignore.
            In In Plato's Cave, Susan Sontag talks about how photography changes the way we experience reality. She explains that photographs feel like pieces of the real world instead of just images of it. I relate to this because when I take a photo, it feels like I am holding onto a moment, even though I know it is only an image. At the same time, I notice that taking photos can create distance. Instead of fully experiencing a moment, I sometimes think about how it will look in a picture. This connects to Sontag's idea that photography can both capture experience and replace it.
            Photography is especially important in representing the world right now because we live in a time where almost everything is documented. Images are constantly shared online, and many of them are edited or staged to look perfect. Because of this, I try to use photography in a more honest way. I focus on imperfections, quiet spaces, and moments that feel real instead of polished. Photos of empty rooms, shadows, or blurred movement can reflect feelings of isolation, uncertainty, or emotional distance that many people experience today.
            I also think the combination of image and text is important. Sontag explains that photographs cannot fully explain anything on their own. A photo can be powerful, but without context, its meaning can change depending on who is looking at it. Adding text, such as captions or short reflections, helps give the image more depth. It allows me to explain why the moment mattered to me and what I was feeling when I took the photo, without taking away the viewer’s ability to interpret it in their own way.
            Overall, photography helps me make sense of the present moment. Even though Sontag warns that living in a world full of images can numb us or make everything feel distant, I think photography can still be meaningful when used thoughtfully. By paying attention to intention and context, photography becomes more than just collecting images. It becomes a way to reflect on how the world feels right now and how I personally experience it.
